# Consulting Handbook

A repository for the [Consulting Handbook](https://isustatistics.github.io/consulting_handbook/) for Statistical Consultants in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. The [Statistical Consulting website](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-consulting) contains more information about our services.

## Proposed outline (as of 2025-10-23).

Preface

1 Introduction

Part I: Client Interactions

-   The First Meeting (listen! understand the scientific question, don't solve their problems right then

-   Active Listening

-   Conflict resolution (telling clients you can't answer the research question, poorly design experiment, treatment not significant)

-   Advising vs Collaboration

-   General advice (avoid statistical jargon, don't expect to know all the statistical procedures out there, ALWAYS plot the data first).

Part II: Statistical Methods

-   Designing Experiments (randomization, experimental vs observational unit, [Power and sample size](https://iastate.box.com/s/yc11t6puccwds1gyz4575fvb6l07nm0s), [recognizing split plots](https://iastate.box.com/s/sll60ecfhb3fiyu91d12niblw02hfb73), screening experiments, using JMP)

-   Contrasts & ANOVA (or ANOVA Nuances)

-   Mixed Models (list correlation structures, residuals, [Hausse / Lenth diagrams](https://iastate.box.com/s/s8clc6ibk5bhv3nq8qsei8as61ykgxv5))

-   GLMs and GLMMs ([mixed model residuals](https://iastate.box.com/s/lf6mqbg83sydjlrtwbp6sga2wuysz311), over-dispersion)

-   Non-negative Data (log transformations, etc.)

-   Missing Data (see [Missing data analysis](https://iastate.box.com/s/b7w83oc9quc43xbvd6tfkghl810mlvuv))

-   Multivariate Data & Machine Learning (contrasts with MANOVA, CCA, EFA, PCA, clustering, etc.)

-   Meta and secondary analysis ([repeated experiments](https://iastate.box.com/s/6uj8pxnpr57r7wxf5y202unu7w9xufd8), broad and narrow sense infrence )

-   P-values (ep log(p), multiple comparisons)

-   Common pitfalls (such as over-valuing p-values, write out your model before coding it in SAS or R, use reputable R packages / textbooks by good authors)

-   Spacial data (what to look for in consulting, resources)

-   [Repeated measures analysis](https://iastate.box.com/s/g2bksh54te5x7zhpysx9kou8ep69ktsb)

-   Specific types of data (meta analysis, model averaging, equivalence testing, propensity scores, mediation analysis / SEM, dose response curves, zero-inflated models, cox proportional hazard / survival analysis, bootstrapping, GAMs, natural language processing)

Part III: Case Studies

-   Drawing from consultant presentations, though we'll need client permission
