# Experimental Design

@frey25blocks explains why you can't remove blocks in a designed experiment.

This particular paper should probably go in a section talking about regression models for a designed experiment with a blocking factor.

We also have Philip's Freedman papers papers about bias with adding covariates (On Regression Adjustments in Experiments with Multiple Treatments's).
